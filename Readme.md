## API Endpoints

1. ` POST /api/v1/register` **Register a User**: Send a POST request to `/api/v1/register` with JSON payload containing username, email, and password.
2. `POST /api/v1/login` **Login User**: Send a POST request to `/api/v1/login` with username and password. You’ll receive a JWT if credentials are valid.
3.  `GET /api/v1/userInfo` **Access Protected Routes - Personal Information**: Send requests to protected routes with `Authorization: httpOnly-cookie <token>` `WithCredintials:True` after logging in to get the information of the logged in user. 
4. `POST api/v1/signout` **Logout User**: Send a POST request to `api/v1/signout`. It clears the token which is stored in the browser and logged out from the browser. If it is logged out, then we can't use the protected route `api/v1/userInfo`.
5.  `POST /api/v1/resetPassword` **Reset Password** : It is used to reset the password.It is used to generate a token which will be used to create a new password. 
5.  `POST /api/v1/setNewPassword` **Set New Password** : After generating a token, you can input the token as key and new password to create a new password.

> [!NOTE]
> The First two routes ***Register*** and ***Login*** are public routes. The remaining are protected routes. Unless you logged in from the browser, you cannot access those protected routes.

## Deployment
